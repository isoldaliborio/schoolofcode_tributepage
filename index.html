        "Paulo Freire was one of the most influential philosophers of education of the twentieth century. He worked wholeheartedly to help people both through his philosophy and his practice of critical pedagogy. A native of Brazil, Freire’s goal was to eradicate illiteracy among people from previously colonized countries and continents. His insights were rooted in the social and political realities of the children and grandchildren of former slaves. His ideas, life, and work served to ameliorate the living conditions of oppressed people." Source: <a href="https://iep.utm.edu/freire/" target="_blank"> Internet Enciclopedia of Filosofy</a>
        Paulo Freire was born in Recife - Pernambuco - Brazil on September 1921.
